# P5AndroidCapture
This is original project source for my [processing](https://processing.org) library named [processing-android-capture](https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture). I develode the whole project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

**processing-android-capture Lib:** [https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture](https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture)
**android client app:** [https://github.com/onlylemi/AndroidCapture](https://github.com/onlylemi/AndroidCapture)

This library tries to transfer data between [Processing](https://processing.org) and [Android](https://android.com). I make a android app to capture the real-time video from `Android Camera` and the real-time data from `Android Sensor` through the socket to the server (processing server) with `WiFi`. The users use this lib to get phone camera frame and sensors data in processing, then can do some interesting things. 

It's only beta named **"Beta2.0"**. Welcome to try it and if there is a problem, please contact me or new a issues.
